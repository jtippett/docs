title: 'Execute Command'
openapi: 'POST /api/profile/{profile_id}/room/{room_id}/command'
---

Executes shell commands within VM instances and returns output with comprehensive file change tracking. This is the core endpoint for running code, scripts, and system commands in your development environments.

## Request Body

```json
{
  "command": "python -c 'print(\"Hello, World!\")'"
}
```

The `command` field accepts any valid shell command that can be executed within the VM environment.

## Use Cases

- **Code Execution**: Run Python scripts, Node.js applications, shell scripts
- **Package Installation**: Install dependencies with npm, pip, apt, etc.
- **File Manipulation**: Create, edit, and organize files and directories
- **Data Processing**: Execute data analysis, transformations, and exports
- **Development Tasks**: Build projects, run tests, compile code

## Response Structure

The response includes detailed information about command execution and any files that were changed:

### Successful Command Execution

```json
{
  "instance_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "command": "python -c 'import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.plot([1,2,3,4]); plt.savefig(\"/tmp/chart.png\")'",
  "result": {
    "output": "",
    "exit_code": 0,
    "files_changed": [
      {
        "path": "/tmp/chart.png",
        "status": "created",
        "size": 12485,
        "mime_type": "image/png",
        "public_url": "/vm/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000/file/tmp/chart.png"
      }
    ]
  },
  "status": "success"
}
```

### Command with Output

```json
{
  "instance_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000", 
  "command": "ls -la /home/user",
  "result": {
    "output": "total 28\ndrwxr-xr-x 5 user user 4096 Jan  7 10:30 .\ndrwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Jan  7 10:25 ..\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  220 Jan  7 10:25 .bash_logout\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 3771 Jan  7 10:25 .bashrc\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 user user 4096 Jan  7 10:30 .cache\n-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  807 Jan  7 10:25 .profile",
    "exit_code": 0,
    "files_changed": []
  },
  "status": "success"
}
```

### Command Failure

```json
{
  "instance_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "command": "python nonexistent_script.py", 
  "result": {
    "output": "python: can't open file 'nonexistent_script.py': [Errno 2] No such file or directory",
    "exit_code": 2,
    "files_changed": []
  },
  "status": "error"
}
```

## File Change Tracking

The API automatically tracks file changes during command execution:

### File Change Types
- `created` - New files that were created
- `modified` - Existing files that were changed  
- `deleted` - Files that were removed

### File Metadata
- **path**: Full path to the changed file
- **size**: File size in bytes
- **mime_type**: Detected MIME type (e.g., `image/png`, `text/plain`)
- **public_url**: Direct URL to access the file without authentication

## Long-running Commands

Commands have reasonable timeout limits, but for very long-running processes:

- Use background processes with `nohup` or `screen`
- Break large tasks into smaller steps
- Consider using interim file outputs to track progress

## Example Commands

### Python Data Analysis
```bash
python -c "
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create sample data  
data = {'x': [1,2,3,4,5], 'y': [2,4,6,8,10]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Create visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
plt.plot(df['x'], df['y'], 'o-')
plt.title('Sample Data')
plt.savefig('/tmp/analysis.png')
print('Analysis complete!')
"
```

### Node.js Package Installation
```bash
npm init -y && npm install express
```

### Git Operations  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git && cd repo && npm install
```

### File Processing
```bash
echo "Processing data..." && cat data.csv | tail -n +2 | cut -d',' -f1,3 > processed.csv
```

## Error Handling

Always check the `exit_code` and `status` fields:

- `exit_code: 0` and `status: "success"` - Command executed successfully
- `exit_code: non-zero` and `status: "error"` - Command failed
- Check the `output` field for error messages and debugging information

## Best Practices

- **Command Composition**: Chain multiple commands with `&&` for conditional execution
- **Output Redirection**: Use `>` and `>>` to capture output to files
- **Error Handling**: Check exit codes before proceeding with dependent operations
- **Resource Management**: Be mindful of CPU and memory usage for intensive operations
- **File Organization**: Use descriptive paths and organize outputs in logical directories
