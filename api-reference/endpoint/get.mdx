title: 'Read File from VM'
openapi: 'GET /api/profile/{profile_id}/room/{room_id}/file/{path}'
---

Reads files from VM instances and returns their content as JSON. This endpoint supports reading any file within the VM filesystem that the user has access to.

## Path Parameter

The `{path}` parameter is a wildcard that captures the full file path within the VM. For example:

- `/home/user/script.py`
- `/tmp/output.json` 
- `/workspace/data/results.csv`
- `/etc/hosts` (if readable)

## Use Cases

- **Result Retrieval**: Read output files generated by executed commands
- **Configuration Access**: Read configuration files and settings
- **Data Export**: Access data files, logs, and generated reports
- **AI Agent File Access**: Allow AI agents to read files they've created or need to analyze

## Response Examples

### Text File Content

```json
{
  "file_path": "/home/user/script.py",
  "content": "#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\nprint('Hello, Gentility!')\n\n# This is a sample Python script\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(f'Count: {i}')",
  "instance_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

### JSON File Content  

```json
{
  "file_path": "/tmp/analysis_results.json",
  "content": "{\n  \"summary\": \"Data analysis complete\",\n  \"total_records\": 1500,\n  \"insights\": [\n    \"Peak usage occurs at 3 PM\",\n    \"Weekend traffic is 40% lower\"\n  ]\n}",
  "instance_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

### Binary File Handling

For binary files, the content will be base64 encoded:

```json
{
  "file_path": "/home/user/chart.png", 
  "content": "iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQCAYAAAAf8/9hAAAABH...",
  "instance_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"
}
```

### File Not Found

```json
{
  "error": "file_not_found",
  "message": "File '/nonexistent/path.txt' not found in instance"
}
```

### Instance Not Found

```json
{
  "error": "instance_not_found", 
  "message": "No instance found for profile 6ba7b810-9dad-11d1-80b4-00c04fd430c8 and room ai-session-123"
}
```

## Alternative: Direct File Access

For unauthenticated access (useful for AI agents), you can also use the direct file access endpoint:

```
GET /vm/{instance_id}/file/{path}
```

This endpoint:
- Requires no authentication
- Serves files with appropriate MIME types
- Returns raw file content (not JSON wrapped)
- Suitable for images, PDFs, and other binary files

## Best Practices

- **File Paths**: Use absolute paths starting from `/` or relative paths from the VM's home directory
- **Large Files**: Be mindful that very large files will be returned as base64 encoded strings
- **Security**: Only files accessible to the VM user can be read
- **Caching**: File content is read fresh on each request - no caching is performed
- **Error Handling**: Always check for 404 errors when files might not exist
