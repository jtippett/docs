- **Execute code safely** - Run commands with real-time output and file change tracking  
- **Access files seamlessly** - Read and write files within VM instances
- **Integrate with AI agents** - Dynamic tool schemas for popular AI frameworks

## Key Features

### ⚡ Instant Provisioning
No more waiting for environments to boot. Our warm pool system ensures VMs are ready when you need them.

### 🔒 Battle-Tested Security
Enterprise-grade isolation with Firecracker microVMs ensures complete separation between workloads.

### 🛠️ AI-First Design
Built from the ground up for AI agents, with dynamic tool schemas and seamless integration patterns.

### 💰 Pay-As-You-Go
No setup fees, no minimums. Only pay for the compute your agents actually use.

### 🌐 Multi-Tenant Architecture
